            <p>Halloween is celebrated by nearly 200 million Americans each year, spending billions of dollars on decorations, candy and costumes. There is a certain mystique involved with Halloween. Are there really ghosts, ghouls, and goblins hiding in the dark? Are there really dark, scary forces out there ready to snatch up our kids and steal their souls? What better way to get into the spirit of these ideas than to carve immaculate jack-o-lanterns, dress like Michael Myers and impose on your neighbors for bags of candy!</p>
