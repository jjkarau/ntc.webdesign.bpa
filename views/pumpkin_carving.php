                        <p>The first thing you need to do is pick the perfect pumpkin. Since our team is from Central Wisconsin, we do have some pumpkin patches that allow you to pick your own pumpkin right from the field. If a hay ride isn't on your list of things to do, many stores do sell pumpkins during the Halloween season.</p>

                                <h2>Cut off the top and the fun won't stop!</h2>
                                <p>An adult should use a knife to cut off the top of the pumpkin. You want to make sure that the opening is large enough to fit your hand inside to clean out the insides. Make sure when you are cutting off the top that you cut at an angle, so there is a bit of a ledge for the top to sit on. Otherwise, the top will fall inside the pumpkin, as the pumpkin will get softer as time goes on. </p>
                            <br /><br />

                                <p>Remove the innards into a bucket, bowl, or other recepticle. This makes it easier to clean up, or if you want to save the guts, you can use them for pumpkin pie and roasted pumpkin seeds. If you seperate out the seeds, you can make a pretty yummy snack. Just baste them with garlic salt and oil then bake until golden brown at 375&deg;F.</p><br /><br />

                        <h2>Carving Templates</h2>
                        <p>If you are struggling with an idea of what to carve on your pumpkin, we have some great suggestions of websites where you can print off templates.</p><br />
                                              
                                <h3><a href="https://family.disney.com/pumpkin-carving-ideas/">Disney Templates</a></h3><br />
                            
                                <h3><a href="http://www.pumpkinlady.com/">The Pumpkin Lady - Over 700 templates to choose from</a></h3><br />
                            
                                <h3><a href="http://www.bhg.com/halloween/pumpkin-carving/pumpkin-carving-stencils-of-favorite-dogs/">Scroll through Better Homes templates to find your favorite dog breed</a></h3><br />
                       
                        <p>After printing off your template, cut as close to the lines as possible. Using an exacto knife, you can cut out the inside of the design. Make sure that you are keeping part of the design to hold the shape. Otherwise you will end up with a giant hole in the side of your pumpkin. </p><br />
                            

                        <h2>Create your Masterpiece</h2>
                        
                        <p>If you are using a template, use some stick pins to hold the design on your pumpkin. An alternative would be using a permanent marker to trace your design on the pumpkin,as you can see on the cat pumpkin. Make sure that a responsible adult safely uses a knife to carve the pumpkin. Most pumpkins are pretty thick, so it can be challenging to cut through all the way. </p><br />


                        <h2>Display your Creative Side</h2>
                        
                        <p>Once you have finished carving your pumpkin it is time to put it on display. Small candles have always worked well to illuminate pumpkins. If it is windy outside, there are battery operated tea lights that also work great for lighting up your design. Place your pumpkin on your front porch or sidewalk, and your house will be decorated for Halloween. Make sure to share pictures of your pumpkin on social media so all of your friends can see your scary side!</p><br />
